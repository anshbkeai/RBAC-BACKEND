so the point is learn aout the how to actually Manage about the trxn. in hte spfing data that is important 

and mpre you can. switch to the Saga Patern. that si mostl y used in the prduction 

4. Ask yourself “what if?” constantly
Here’s a checklist seniors subconsciously run every time they touch code:
Category	Questions to Ask Yourself
Null Safety	What if this value is null?
Concurrency	What if two threads do this at once?
Data Integrity	Can duplicates or invalid states sneak in?
Failure Handling	What happens if save() throws an exception?
Scalability	Will this still work if 1000 users call it per second?
Maintainability	Will another dev understand what I did here 6 months from now?
It’s not paranoia — it’s preventive architecture.


//Cooreloation id : about to trace back and aboout to  create about the Full flow

// and more about that we have gone to that part and more 
//“I implemented simple audit logging using AOP in the same database because my project doesn’t require high traffic.

But I explored scalable approaches like using RabbitMQ and a separate audit service. I
 didn’t implement them because that architecture only makes sense at higher scale, 
 but understanding it helps me design better systems in the future.”

More get in the Concpet anout that 
Annotations in that 
like about target type and reterton once like about that to


// More about that we need to make aboout the things like more important is that
// Why are we selection 
topic exhage and direct exhage . => i know we did it but need to opitmise or revisit them


and in the App_user_core_Serrvice_implementation 
that add will be in the same transction event and propagation must be same.  
else you will fucked up


and more in the organisation/info any one auth in the app can see other organisation so that should 
not be implemented . you can only see about the organisation you have created and yor are enrolled 
and in the enroller you can only see about the who created you who invideted ypu. .
your roles and permssion in that org .
